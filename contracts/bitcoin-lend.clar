;; Bitcoin Lend: Secure Lending Protocol for Stacks Blockchain
;;
;; A decentralized lending protocol built on Stacks, designed for Bitcoin
;; compatibility with Layer 2 optimizations. This contract enables users to
;; deposit STX as collateral, borrow against their collateral, and earn 
;; interest by providing liquidity to the protocol.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Collateralized borrowing with configurable ratios
;; - Dynamic interest calculation based on block height
;; - Automatic liquidation mechanism
;; - Protocol fee collection system
;; - Emergency pause functionality
